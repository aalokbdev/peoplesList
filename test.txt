To implement this task while adhering to SOLID principles, best design patterns, and coding practices, here's a breakdown:

Implementation Strategy
1. Structure
Organize the application into the following directories:

components/: Reusable components like tables, buttons, modals, etc.
pages/: UserList and UserDetails pages.
services/: API interaction logic.
hooks/: Custom React hooks.
contexts/: For global state management.
utils/: Helper functions, constants, and error-handling utilities.
tests/: Unit and integration tests.
2. Key SOLID Principles
Single Responsibility: Each component or function should handle one responsibility (e.g., Table only displays data; API service only fetches data).
Open-Closed: Use extensible components and avoid modifying existing ones unnecessarily.
Liskov Substitution: Base components should work seamlessly when extended or replaced (e.g., Pagination component should support different types of lists).
Interface Segregation: Split complex components into smaller ones (e.g., Pagination vs. Table).
Dependency Inversion: Decouple high-level components from low-level modules using context or hooks.
Design Patterns
Container-Presenter:

Separate logic from UI. For instance:
UserListContainer handles fetching and pagination logic.
UserList handles displaying the UI.
Repository Pattern:

Encapsulate API calls in a service (e.g., userService.js).
Error Boundary:

Use an ErrorBoundary component to catch and display errors.
Factory Pattern:

Use factories for creating paginated data or mock responses for tests.




Solid React App
Design Patterns Used
Container-Presenter Pattern:

UserList is the container component handling state, data fetching, and business logic.
UserTable is the presenter component that focuses on UI rendering.
Repository Pattern:

userService.js acts as the repository, encapsulating API calls and separating data access logic from components.
Error Boundary:

The error state in UserList is part of an error boundary concept to catch errors and display messages.
Factory Pattern (implied):

The structure allows easily adding a factory to provide mock data or handle variations in user data creation.
Pagination Component:

The pagination component uses Single Responsibility to handle page transitions only.
